# Bander_Saleh_C-_XAML_Class_Notes_1
 1-24-2023 --> About Computer Programming III classwork project. Uploading kinda late because I wanted the experience of successfully completing the app from class using all the new tools we are introduced to. My notes are mixed with Pseudocode throughout the numerous pages that make the app. The app functions right now are for the Animals List and the Class Info List.
